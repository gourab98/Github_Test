# All The problems:

### When you have a existing git repo and you want to add that repo in your local folder for managing your git repo from there!
> First you have to create a new folder from where you want to manage your git repo. Then, open your command prompt from there and use that command (For example):

```
git clone https://github.com/gourab98/Github_Test.git
```

> After cloning that repo, Open that project with your VS code. Now you can make changes.
