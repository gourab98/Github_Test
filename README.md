# Problems:

## 1. When you have a existing git repo and you want to add that repo in your local folder for managing your git repo from there? (The solution here is using VS code)

### Prerequisites:
* Git
* VS CODE (Have to Log in using github account)
* Git Extension Pack (Open VS Code, Go to extensions, then install this extension)
### Performing the following steps:

> First you have to create a new folder from where you want to manage your git repo. Then, open your command prompt from there and use that command 
```
git clone "url_of_your_repository"
```
(For example):

```
git clone https://github.com/gourab98/Github_Test.git
```

> After cloning that repo, Open that project with your VS code. Now you can make changes. Now you can push those changes to your remote repo. You can even do all kind of stafs from there. (For example, you can add a new file, commit those changes, push those changes to your remote repo and so on)

> In the sources control panel, you can see the status of your local and remote repo. You can commit all your changes and push those changes to your remote repo from there.
